# ConsoleDodgingGame
 Game about dodging stuff.

You can play the game by using the arrow keys or WASD.  
The game automatically sets window size on start; resizing window can eventually break something.

Game executable found under Spill. Whole game takes about 200 mb due to being self contained with all c# libraries.

**You need to allow the .exe file to run, as it will be blocked by Windows :((**
